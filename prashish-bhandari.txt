5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

    Every element has a box around it. There's the content which is surrounded by padding on all sides. The border is the container that goes around the padding and content. All of the white spaces outside of the border is margin. We can manipulate these properties with any values we give.
    When you set the width/height of an element, it also takes into account the element's border and padding and adds to the width/height. To fix this, we can use the property border-sizing and set the value to border-box. This makes it so that the padding and border are included in the width and height of the element so the width/height you set is actually the width/height you get.
